## 🚀 About The Report

**Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs)** are a cornerstone of modern cryptography, enabling **verifiable computation without revealing private data**. Yet, a major bottleneck impedes broader adoption:
→ **The immense computational cost of generating proofs.**

This interactive report breaks down the *SZKP* paper, which introduces a **groundbreaking ASIC accelerator** achieving \~**465× speedup** over high-end CPUs by directly addressing this challenge.

The application guides users through:

* **The Problem**: Why ZKP generation is so slow, with a focus on computational bottlenecks like **MSM (Multi-Scalar Multiplication)** and **NTT (Number Theoretic Transform)**.
* **The Solution**: A deep dive into the **SZKP architecture**, including innovations like **complete on-chip acceleration** and a **scalable memory system**.
* **The Proof**: Performance comparisons showcasing SZKP’s **order-of-magnitude improvements** over CPUs, GPUs, and other ASICs.
* **The Context**: An overview of the **emerging ZKP hardware landscape** and the **commercial ecosystem** forming around it.
